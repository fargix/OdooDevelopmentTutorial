"In the early scenario, the business sector faced many challenges with respect to its project management or task management. \n"
"#odoo15developmentvideos\n"
"\n"
"The people involved in the task- like Project Managers, Team Leaders, Operation Managers, Scheduling Managers, Work Managers, or Marketing Managers used paper to plan their schedules with colored blocks, which was quite hectic in terms of viewing the project progression. #odoo15videos\n"

"Good inventory management also helps businesses to decrease their costs, pace up their success operations, and stop any possibilities of business fraud. However, managing the stock is now not that easy as we seem to be from outside. It has to go through various complex steps and follow-ups to preserve the right balance. Moreover, it is on the groundwork of your company’s inventory, the organizations survey their modern assets, supply economic reporting, balance the accounts.&#13;\n"
"\n"
"Thus it is a complex phenomenon in the inventory management of your business. But these complex proceedings can be simplified with an ERP solution. An enterprise resource planning software can reduce the overheads and optimize turns in the inventory. The automated management makes everything streamlined and ensures the right balance of stock in your warehouse. In the case of stock depletion, ERP takes care of stock replenishments with reordering rules and others.&#13;\n"

"Securing the database is very important to keep data safe in odoo and to isolate customer databases running on the same cluster. So we need to make the best practices in terms of users, passwords, access control management.\n"
"\n"
"Video Contents:\n"
"00:00 Introduction\n"
"00:35 Key points to secure Odoo 13 database\n"
"01:27 Secure Odoo 13 Database\n"
"01:48 Configuration of Odoo Config file\n"
"10:39 Configuration of PostgreSQL\n"
"13:00 Connection Settings of PostgreSQL Configuration\n"
"16:12  Security and Authentication for PostgreSQL\n"
"\n"
"First, let us go through some key points related to securing the Odoo 13 database:\n"
"\n"
"Set a strong super-admin password, and restrict access to the database management pages as soon as the system is set up\n"
"Unique logins and strong passwords for all admin accounts on all databases\n"
"\n"
"Better not to install demo data that may contain default logins and passwords which is not secure to use\n"
"\n"
"Use database filters to restrict the visibility of your databases according to the hostname\n"
"\n"
"Make sure the PostgreSQL user (db_user) is not a super-user\n"
"\n"
"Now let us discuss the configurations that can be done to enhance the security of the database:\n"
"\n"
"In odoo.config file adds some database settings which include:\n"
"\n"
"admin_password-- admin_password is a master database password that is set at first boot and can be set from front end also.It is used to manage the databases ie. To create,duplicate,delete,backup and restore databases.\n"
"\n"
"db_host--To specify the database host.By default it is localhost\n"
"db_port--The database port(by default it is None)\n"
"db_user--Database User name\n"
"db_password--Database password for db_user\n"
"db_maxconn--Maximum number of physical connections to postgresql\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"db_name and db_filter:\n"
"\n"
"It is used to determine which database should be used to load the website page\n"
"\n"
"Database should be selected based on the hostname (domain) that is being requested.Odoo is an multi-tenant system that run and serve a number of database instances which is not an issue for a logged in company user who can log-in and select the databases.But users like website users and portal users are not bound to the database.So it is neccessery to decide which database needed to be used to load the website page.\n"
" db_filter value contains a regular expression, that includes the dynamically injected hostname (%h) or the first subdomain (%d) through which the system is being accessed.\n"
"\n"
"Following can be added to the configuration file\n"
"\n"
"[options]\n"
"\n"
"db_filter = ^yourcompany.*$  (It shows only databases matching the first subdomain)\n"
"db_name=yourcompany ( This database only will be loaded)\n"
"\n"
"If db_name value is given as false, then all databases are loaded\n"
"\n"
"See the changes by restarting the service\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Configuring PostgreSQL\n"
"\n"
"In pg_hba.conf file:\n"
"\n"
"Here you can add local connections with address, methods and it is possible to allow replication connection from local host by a user with replication privilage.\n"
"\n"
"In postgresql.conf file:\n"
" \n"

"Security - Groups and access rights in odoo\n"
"\n"
"Security access in Odoo is configured through security groups: permissions are given to groups and then groups are assigned to users. Odoo has a lot of groups. Once you know about groups, you can select groups from the list of groups.\n"
"\n"
"Security is a major concern when an application is considered. We can control what the user can do and what users can't-do on a different level. Control independently each of the four basic operations: read, write, create, and unlink. I.e. allow only read, allow only create, grant permission to create or delete only. Also, we can hide fields or menus for some users and show them for others, make fields read-only for some users and make them editable for others. We use groups to control users.\n"
"\n"
"Get the module from our repository: https://github.com/CybroOdoo/openacademy\n"
"\n"
"Aside from manually managing access using custom code, Odoo provides two main data-driven mechanisms to manage or restrict access to data.\n"
"\n"
"Each access control has a model to which it grants permissions, the permissions it grants and optionally a group.\n"
"\n"
"If no group is specified, the access control applies to all users, otherwise, it only applies to the members of the given group.\n"
"\n"
"In Odoo, views and menus are restricted to a user due to access right permission. Only admin has the right to view all records. Access right permission is managed by creating an ir.model.access.csv file.\n"
"\n"
"This file can\n"
"\n"
"a) Grant permission like reading, write, update, and delete to a model.\n"
"\n"
"b) Can assign groups. If no group is assigned access right is applicable for all users. Else applicable only for users in that particular group\n"
"\n"
"Available permissions are creation (perm_create), searching and reading (perm_read), updating existing records (perm_write) and deleting existing records (perm_unlink)\n"

"\n"
"Pivot view repeatedly generates table dynamically, while changing the field or row or column. The user can select the row and column field to represent the table. Each time when a user changes the fields, it calls corresponding SQL queries and produces tables accordingly. So Pivot tables are called as dynamic analysis matrix.\n"

This will help in situations where we need to make quick business decisions as it will display all the necessary information in one place in an easy to analyze manner.

"This video explains how we can create a  printed PDF Report in Odoo 14.\n"
"\n"
"A report engine of Odoo is a combination of Qweb, bootstrap, Wkhtmltopdf. \n"
"\n"
"Odoo uses Qweb as a templating engine which is used for converting XML to HTML. Moreover, Qweb properties are set as XML attributes which start with ‘t-‘ (example: t-if for checking conditions in an XML file). Furthermore, we use Qweb for defining the report templates that are written in HTML format, the same as creating a web page.\n"
"\n"
"Wkhtmltopdf is used to render PDFs from the Qweb templates. Additionally, the templates are defined in HTML format as we discussed in the above section therefore, wkhtmltopdf will render the PDF report from the Qweb.\n"
"\n"
"How do Qweb Reports work in Odoo?\n"
"The reports are working with Report Actions and Report Templates. Additionally, the report templates are used in report actions. Moreover, a report action is triggered while printing a report that you can either call this report action from the Print menu or from a python function. In addition, you can set up a custom page format as per the need in Odoo that will be specified in the report action.\n"
"\n"
"Report Actions (ir.actions.report)\n"
"Odoo has several types of actions to perform different kinds of operations or processes such as the reports are generated when the report action is triggered. Furthermore, the report action will be recognized by model ‘ir.actions.report’ used in the record."
